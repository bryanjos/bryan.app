## Who Am I?

Smart, curious, ambitious. Proud, reliable, loyal. Weird, quiet, walks to the beat of his own drum. Creator. Leader. These words describe me well.

I am a New Orleanian, born and bred from a mother with west coast roots. My stepfather used to tell me this poem:

> Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best.

Whoever wrote that poem, it has had a great effect on my life. Greatness happens not at once, but incrementally. Through hard work and practice.

My hobbies include playing videos games, listening to music, and learning. I love flexing my creative muscles as well. Be it through painting, music production, or some other means.

I graduated from UNO in 2007 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I am a strong believer in Open Source. I have created and contributed to Open Source projects. Most of them are in the Elixir community. I have spoken at ElixirConf in 2015 and Lonestar ElixirConf in 2017. I've been on podcasts and even had my own once. I care a lot about contributing to the growth of the tech community here in New Orleans. I have volunteered at Operation Spark and spoken at meetups in the area. In 2014 and 2015, I organized the Open Source Hackathon. As of 2018 I am a co-organizer of The Big Elixir conference, an annual Elixir conference in New Orleans.
