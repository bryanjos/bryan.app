Naming is hard.

But when inspiration strikes, I need something to call the project!

How do I do it?

First, I take the main theme of the project and find terms associated with it. I also look at synonyms of either the main theme or any of the terms that caught my interest as a name.

Next, I ponder on any spelling varients that could work. I'm not good at this step.

Sometimes I look at domain names. This is the first step for a lot of people but I like to come to the domain name with
some ideas of possible names.

Last, I pick the closest thing I like. If the idea catches on there will be time for a more robust naming session.
