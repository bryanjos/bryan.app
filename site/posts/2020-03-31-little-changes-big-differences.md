I have hypertension.

Kept under control by medicine.

I also have white coat hypertension.

I am part of a program where I take my blood pressure readings at home. A health coach, pharmacist, and my doctor monitor my readings to see if any changes in medicine are needed.

This has works well and gives me a better understanding of my body.

I have a personal trainer.

During my workouts, I would get lightheaded. I turned out to be low blood pressure.

My health team recommeded taking one of my medicines at night.

There was no effect on my workout.

This is because the medication I still take in the morning goes into full effect around my workout time.

I told my health team. They suggested taking my medicine after workouts on workout days.

The change was significant!

I was not lightheaded during my workout.

I felt like a different person.

Stronger.

Faster.

I enjoy the relationship with my health team and their dedication to helping me be the best I can.

This has shown me how much medicine can have an effect on you and also how important it is to talk to your doctor about any issues or changes in exercise.
